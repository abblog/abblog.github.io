##Long Bio:

Aaron is a father/husband, hacker, entrepreneur, public speaker, and senior technology leader… often in that order. For the past 15 years, he has been passionate about building consumer internet products and has reached 100’s of millions of consumers and billions of page views per month at [Blockbuster](http://blockbuster.com), [RevolutionHealth](http://revolutionhealth.com), [HungryMachine](https://aaronbatalion.com/post/31009701702/eddie-val-tim-and-i-started-a-consulting), and [LivingSocial](http://livingsocial.com).

As co-founder and CTO of LivingSocial, he helped build the team and grow the company from 4 people to 4000 across 25 countries, while building, scaling, and innovating on a local marketplace to buy and share the best things to do in your city.  LivingSocial has run the four largest deals ever in this space. In 2013, the company had $400M in revenue on over $1B in sales.

Prior to social commerce, LivingSocial was the largest application on the Facebook platform, growing 0 to 35M users in just three weeks with the launch of [PickYour5](https://aaronbatalion.com/post/31010390347/reached-our-goal-of-1-application-on-the-facebook), some of the fastest organic growth ever seen on the Facebook platform. He pushed his cofounders to name the company HungryMachine, because it was the perfect combination of passion applied through technology.

He has successfully built [technology teams](https://aaronbatalion.com/post/31011355992/livingsocial-engineering-culture) at multiple companies with a focus on [data-driven iterative product development](https://aaronbatalion.com/post/30985249845/entrepreneur-perspective-finding-your-business) with the ethos that building software is easy, but building successful products is hard. He is a regular speaker on technology & entrepreneurship at conferences like [SxSW](https://www.udemy.com/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations/#lecture/76799), [Tech Cocktail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O26WoN6qvfw), [RailsConf](https://aaronbatalion.com/post/30985680998/the-livingsocial-story-keynote-railsconf-2011), and more.

Before the internets, Aaron attended Lehigh University on a full scholarship where he received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Asian Studies, with a concentration in Japanese Language and Eastern Religion.  The latter was an hack for him to travel around Asia on someone else's dime. The hack worked.

Today, Aaron lives and works in San Francisco with his beautiful wife and young sons.

<p class="p1">What an incredible journey it has been since June of 2007, when the four of us knew only our direction, but definitely not our destination. After much soul searching, I have decided to leave LivingSocial to pursue some new ideas.  No new adventure to announce yet, just a urge to go create… that there is more to do.</p>
<p class="p1">As I look back today, we have processed billions in commerce transactions and have sent tens of billions of emails on technology we created.  We took a simple two-week prototype and scaled it to an international business with thousands of fellow employees around the world.  We built a culture I am proud of and millions of consumers around the world have experienced their local cities because of our products. More importantly, we created an incredible team with many more strong moves yet to come. Knowing this makes me confident in LivingSocial’s future and the vision of local we have all been fighting for.</p>
<p class="p1">I am incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished to date and have been so fortunate to play a role in this amazing journey.  My decision to depart has in no way been easy. The experience and, most importantly, the friendships… have been the best of my career.</p>

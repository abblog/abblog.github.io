<p><a href="http://www.nfte.com/" title="NFTE" target="_blank">NFTE</a> (Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship) is an organization which inspires young people to succeed in school and in life by seizing educational opportunities and starting their own businesses.  NFTE is a world leader in promoting entrepreneurship and enables youth to achieve greater academic, personal, professional and financial success. And NFTE continues to receive accolades for its novel approach to entrepreneurial education. Recently, US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that &#8220;There is no one in the country doing a better job than NFTE.&#8221; The New York Times published a Thomas Friedman article saying &#8220;the president should also vow to bring NFTE to every low-income neighborhood in America.&#8221; In January 2011, The White House named NFTE a member of the Startup America Partnership to dramatically increase the prevalence and success of American entrepreneurs.</p>
